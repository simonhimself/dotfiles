description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces
---

Build UI components, pages, or applications with exceptional design quality that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

First, invoke the skill tool to load the frontend-design skill:

```
skill({ name: 'frontend-design' })
```

Then follow the skill's design philosophy:
1. Commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction (brutally minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, etc.)
2. Apply material honesty and obsessive detail
3. Use sophisticated typography (avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial)
4. Create intentional color palettes
5. Generate polished code with exceptional attention to aesthetics
